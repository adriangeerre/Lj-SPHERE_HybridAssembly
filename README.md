# _Lj_-SPHERE Hybrid Assembly

This repository contains the [GWF](https://gwf.app/) pipeline for the assembly improvement of the _Lotus japonicus_ synthetic community genomes. The code is divided into i) hybryd assembly, ii) 16S taxonomic identification, and iii) plasmid detection. Genome scaffolding is now deprecated and only mantained for the pre-print version. This pipeline was built to run in an High-Performance Computing enviroment (such as, [GenomeDK](https://genome.au.dk/)) using the Slurm queue system. For detailed information on how this pipeline works please read:
