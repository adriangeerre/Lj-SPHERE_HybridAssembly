# LjSC Hybrid Assembly

This repository contains the [GWF](https://gwf.app/) pipeline for the assembly improvement of the _Lotus japonicus_ synthetic community genomes. The code is divided into i) hybryd assembly, ii) 16S taxonomic identification, and iii) genome scaffolding. This pipeline was built to run in an High-Performance Computing enviroment (such as, [GenomeDK](https://genome.au.dk/)) using the Slurm queue system. For detailed information on how this pipeline works please read: [CITATION!!!]
